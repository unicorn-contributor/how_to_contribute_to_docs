This repo will be used as an example for a post on Medium that explains how to contribute to an open-source project's documentation

You can apply changes to the documentation directly on Github. Just click on edit button and modify the documentation. After that you will be asked to commit your changes. Give a title to your commit and leave a brief comment that explains what you changed. Commit to a new branch and create a Pull Request to merge your changes to the master.

You can also apply changes locally on you machine. Use git to create a new branch, apply your changes there and then create a new commit. When you will be ready push them to the origin and go back to Github to create a Pull Request.
